# SSH

## Description

In this project, I became familiar connecting to and working with servers using the SSH protocol. I worked on a server provided by ALX.

## Tasks

1. **Use a private key**
   - `0-use_a_private_key`: Bash script that uses ssh to connect to my ALX-provided server.

2. **Create an SSH key pair**
   - `1-create_ssh_key_pair`: Bash script that creates an RSA key pair.

3. **Client configuration file**
   - `2-ssh_config`: SSH configuration file configured to use the private key `~/.ssh/school` and to refuse authentication using a password.
